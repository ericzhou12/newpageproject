      content: `I know it's been quite a while since we last updated, but we've been very busy working on expanding our project. Our previous work has allowed us to donate over 10,000 books and impact over 680 students. Because of these efforts, we've received a grant from Hershey's Heartwarming project, which receives over 3,000 applications a year. We are very grateful for this opportunity to bring more possibilities to our project. We are looking into the best ways to utilize this amazing grant to further our impact.

The Detroit Committee of the Princeton Prize in Race Relations has also selected us to receive a Certificate of Accomplishment for our work in furthering racial equity in Michigan. This recognition is a great honor, and we are so grateful for this certificate. Moving past this great accomplishment, we have also been recognized as part of the Major Group for Children and Youth. The MGCY is the UN General Assembly-mandated and self-organized mechanism for young people to meaningfully engage in certain UN processes. This is a great way for us to engage with more the community at large!

After all of these great accomplishments, we set our sights on greater destinations: more members! Make sure to check out our team page to see our newly appointed executive board!`,

      content: `Our visit to River Rouge STEM academy started off strong, with all three of us not knowing how to enter the school. Out of fear of seeming like burglars, we had to ask one of the kids how to reach the main office. After walking the outside of the school twice, we eventually found the entrance, which led us to a hallway I can only begin to describe as magical. The walls were painted bright colors, there were decorations and the sound of children laughing bouncing off the walls. Everyone we saw greeted us with a bright smile, even though I'm sure we must have seemed lost and out of place.

After meeting with one of the wonderful ladies at the front office we were led up a flight of stairs to finally see where the magic was happening. As we climbed up the flight of stairs, and walked down the hallways, we could see just how much effort went into creating the endearing ambience of the school. The walls were covered in lovingly drawn cartoons and assignments, and the happy chattering coming from the classrooms.

We eventually met with Mrs. Zmich (pronounced like Brick but with a "Zm" instead of a "Br"!!!). Thankfully, her students were out on lunch, so we were able to talk with her uninterrupted. She provided us with so much helpful information, and really showed us the impact that we were able to create on this tight knit community. In just 20 short minutes, the kids were back from lunch, and we were thrust into the spotlight. We gave an impromptu speech about who we were (3 high schoolers), what we wanted to achieve (equal access education), and how we achieved it (with the help of many, many gracious people and organizations)!

The floor gave way to questions, and we were off! Almost everyone had something to say, and we were blown away by the positivity we received. Something that came up was our own personal relationship with education. All three of us are immigrants, and we have all seen firsthand how a lack of resources can negatively impact people. Being able to help others who are experiencing the same difficulties we did is so rewarding.`,

      excerpt: 'Our second donation from the Bloomfield Hills Library went much better than expected. We picked up over 20 boxes and met with the head librarian.',
      content: `Our second donation from the Bloomfield Hills Library went much better than expected. We picked up over 20 boxes and met with the head librarian there. After an incredibly eye-opening conversation with her, we left the library with a very large amount of books and an invaluable amount of advice.

Her parting words were incredibly encouraging, "You're going to have to tell me to stop giving you books, because I'll keep supplying them until you do." Our drive home was very productive, as we spent the 20-minute car ride discussing and expanding on ideas to provide stability and education for the children of River Rouge.

We got to our destination -- my garage. Unloading the books and gathering the supplies did nothing but energize us more. Sitting on an old tarp with the smell of peaches wafting through the air, we were ready to start. We decided that weighing the books would be an interesting way to track our books in addition to the counting we were doing. So, we delegated roles and got into the thick of it.

Sarah was weighing them, Swathi was counting them, and I was tracking the amounts and helping out wherever needed. I'm not so sure that Swathi enjoyed counting boxes of books repeatedly, but I'd like to think that I made it much more tolerable with my humor.

After two hours of work, we were done. We had just finished organizing our biggest donation so far. Over 1,680 books were donated, bringing our total donations to around 5,000 books. The weight of this donation was 650 pounds. We finished packing the books and said our goodbyes.

Now onto our next adventure!`,
